## Producer consumer problem using point-to-point communication primitives 

## Steps to run:
**NOTE**: For automated plot generation, please install the python3 and matplotlib

1. execute run script from terminal, it will run the program and generate the plots automatically  
     ./run.sh

## Logic for Producer Consumer Mapping:
I have assigned even ranks to producer and odd ranks to consumer. Mapping like 0->1, 2->3.   
So, the data is always send on the same node, no data transfer across the nodes which improve the performance.  

## Observations from plots:
